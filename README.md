# How to use esp8266 on temperature api?
This code is used to upload temperature and humidity in a specified interval. 
The data is uploaded to htxen.dk's servers, 
all students at our school have access to the data via our api. 
You can check out the function of all APIs at docs.htxen.dk

## What do i need?
This code is made for DHT-11!
Right now we only made code for the esp8266. 
You can try to use this code on other microcontrollers, we will add more in future.
You are more than welcome to make a pull request!

## How to setup
First, you must have an api account on htxen.dk, and it must be in accecs level 5 or higher!!!
