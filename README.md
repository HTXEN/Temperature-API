# How to use esp8266 on temperature api?
This code is used to upload temperature and humidity in a specified interval. 
The data is uploaded to htxen.dk's servers, 
all students at our school have access to the data via our api. 
You can check out the function of all APIs at docs.htxen.dk

## What do i need?
Right now we only made code for the esp8266 and the DHT-11. 
You can try to use this code on other microcontrollers, we will add more in future.
You are more than welcome to make a pull request!

## How to setup
First, you must have an api account on htxen.dk, and it must be in accecs level 5 or higher!!!
### Specs
First find out which temperature and humidity sensor you have.
Select the folder with the name of your temperature and humidity sensor,
if you can't find a folder with your temperature and humidity sensor, it means we don't support it yet!
You are more than welcome to help by creating a pull request, remember it MUST be a temperature and humidity sensor.

### Install
Installation is very easy, just fill in the variables and press upload!
You also need to install the liberies, you can do that in the libery tab or download them from the web.
All sources have a link to their website!
